# Immutable-Passport-Integration-Guide
This guide will explain how to integrate Immutable Passsport into a simple application using a step by step approach.

For this step I will clone a repository I created few weeks ago. Using your preferred terminal, these are the steps to follow:

go to the First_Solidity_Project repository

# Step 2: Registering the application on Immutable Developer Hub
