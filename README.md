# Immutable-Passport-Integration-Guide
This guide will explain how to integrate Immutable Passsport into a simple application using a step by step approach.

Step 1: Creating a simple application or git cloning a repository of the simple application 
For this step I will clone a repository I created few weeks ago. Using your preferred terminal, these are the steps to follow:
type git version 
You should see the version of git installed in your computer. If you see an error message, Install git by using the following link: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

go to the First_Solidity_Project repository

Step 2: Registering the application on Immutable Developer Hub
